# waterbucketchallenge

The water bucket challenge (or water jug problem) is a puzzle similar to the concept of diophantine equations, where we search for combinations of X and Y multiplied by integers to form a third number, usually called Z.
Here we have two buckets with a given capacity, and we have to find a combination of those that works to make that Z.

Test Case 1:
    Bucket X: 2
    Bucket Y: 10
    Amount wanted Z: 4 
    Expected outcome: A sequence of actions to measure exactly 4 liters of water.

Test Case 2:
    Bucket X: 2
    Bucket Y: 100
    Amount wanted Z: 96
    Expected outcome: A sequence of actions to measure exactly 96 liters of water.
